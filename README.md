## Key Idea
Decompose Multivariate Time as Latent Functions Factors + Online Filtering

## Requirements:
The project is mainly built with **pytorch 2.3.0** under **python 3.10**. The detailed package info can be found in `requirement.txt`.

## Instructions:
1. Clone this repository.
2. To play with the model quickly, we offer several notebooks at `notebook`(on synthetic & real data)
3. To run the real-world datasets with scripts, see `run_script.sh` for example. (download the processed data of *Solar-Power* and *Uber-Move*  from the link below first)
4. To tune the (hyper)parametrs of model, modify the `.yaml` files in `config` folder
5. To apply the model on your own dataset, please follow the [process_script](https://github.com/xuangu-fang/BayOTIDE/tree/master/data/process_script) to process the raw data into appropriate format.
6. GPU choice: the models are run on CPU by default, but you can change the device to CPU by modifying the `device` as `cpu` of `.yaml` files in the `config` folder.


## Data

We offer the **raw data**,  **processed data** and **processed scripts** for all three datasets used in paper. Given the large size of  *Solar-Power* and *Uber-Move*, we put them in the [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KtxKwGaUAFnKWXwjUzjZ64hmYlda2Qtl?usp=sharing).

- Traffic-Guangzhou: [raw data](https://github.com/xuangu-fang/BayOTIDE/blob/master/data/raw/tensor.mat), [processed scripts](https://github.com/xuangu-fang/BayOTIDE/blob/master/data/process_script/data_process_guangzhou.ipynb), and [processed data](https://github.com/xuangu-fang/BayOTIDE/tree/master/data/guangzhou) 

- Solar-Power: [raw data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KtxKwGaUAFnKWXwjUzjZ64hmYlda2Qtl?usp=sharing), [processed scripts](https://github.com/xuangu-fang/BayOTIDE/blob/master/data/process_script/data_process_solor.ipynb), and [processed data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KtxKwGaUAFnKWXwjUzjZ64hmYlda2Qtl?usp=sharing) 

- Uber-Move: [raw data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KtxKwGaUAFnKWXwjUzjZ64hmYlda2Qtl?usp=sharing), [processed scripts](https://github.com/xuangu-fang/BayOTIDE/blob/master/data/process_script/data_process_uber.ipynb), and [processed data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KtxKwGaUAFnKWXwjUzjZ64hmYlda2Qtl?usp=sharing) 


The code for generating the synthetic data is also provided in the [notebook]( https://github.com/xuangu-fang/BayOTIDE/blob/master/data/process_script/gen_simu.ipynb).


If you wanna customize your own data to play the model, please follow the notebooks in `data/process_script/`.
